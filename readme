if Travis Ci could not detect Maven or Gradle files, Travis CI java builder will use Ant to build it.
By defaut, it will use:

ant test

to run your tests, which means in .travis.yml file, adding "script: ant test" or without this specification, travis CI will always run the test by executing: ant test
